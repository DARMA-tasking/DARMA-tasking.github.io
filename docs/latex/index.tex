{\itshape Efficient, distributed task-\/based programming made easy}

Welcome to the DARMA documentation!

The DARMA project is positioned at the forefront of asynchronous many-\/task (AMT) research and development (R\&D), providing production-\/quality dynamic runtime software for scientific HPC applications. DARMA provides powerful capabilities for dynamically scheduling tasks, incrementally (re-\/)balancing loads, data serialization \& movement, and programming abstractions that yield performance portability. The DARMA team partners with key application/domain-\/specific teams to drive development, implement requisite functionality, and production-\/harden runtime software tailored to Sandiaâ€™s mission-\/critical applications.

DARMA has two organizations on Github\+: one for the public facing code and another for private/internal code, which has not be formally released.

\item DARMA Public Organization\+: \href{https://github.com/DARMA-tasking}{\texttt{ DARMA-\/tasking}}
\item DARMA Private/\+Internal Organization\+: \href{https://github.com/DARMA-tasking-internal}{\texttt{ DARMA-\/tasking-\/internal}}
\end{DoxyItemize}

The DARMA teams develops an integrated toolkit of codes/repositories that work together to provide efficient, task-\/based distributed processing on large supercomputer architectures. The main public repositories are\+:
