For instance, if a trigger is registered with a 100ms period, it will be called approximately every 100ms while the <bold><emphasis>vt</emphasis></bold> progress function is being invoked. If the progress function (or <bold><emphasis>vt</emphasis></bold> scheduler) is called infrequently, the triggers may be delayed depending on the period. Also, if large work units are enqueued in the <bold><emphasis>vt</emphasis></bold> scheduler that take longer than the time period, the trigger will fire as often as it can in between these pieces of work (the component does not use interrupts to trigger actions).</para><para>To register a trigger, call <computeroutput><ref refid="namespacevt_1a1e1a39cdf2a3fc1adefcdfcca4716bf2" kindref="member">vt::theTimeTrigger()</ref>-&gt;addTrigger(100ms, []{ /* my action */});</computeroutput>.
