<title>What is checkpoint?</title>
<para>\checkpoint is a serialization and checkpointing library written in C++14. It allows any C++ type that has a serialize method or free function associated with it to be recursively traversed and transformed by the library. For instance, if the user wants to send over the network, the traversal will create a byte buffer that contains all the data for a message. <computeroutput>DARMA/checkpoint</computeroutput> is a general library that can also be used for other purposes such as I/O<mdash/>creating snapshots of objects to disk.</para>
